# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python

This repository contains an implementation of the linear regression algorithm using only the Numpy library, without the use of specialized machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The aim of this project is to provide a hands-on approach for those looking to understand the basics of linear regression algorithm.

The project includes step-by-step coding in a Jupyter notebook, covering the following topics:

* Data and Library Loading
* Data Visualization
* Cost Function Computation
* Gradient Descent
* Cost Function Visualization
* Convergence Plotting
* Linear Regression Fit with Training Data
* Inference using Optimized Theta Values

This project is based on a guided project from Coursera's Linear Regression with NumPy and Python course <https://www.coursera.org/projects/linear-regression-numpy-python>.
